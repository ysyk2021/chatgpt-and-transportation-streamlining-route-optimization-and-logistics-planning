In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental concepts and characteristics of ChatGPT, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT has made significant strides in various fields, including transportation, streamlining route optimization, and logistics planning.

1.1 Introduction to ChatGPT
---------------------------

ChatGPT is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model that belongs to the GPT-3.5 architecture. GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," and it signifies the model's ability to generate human-like text based on the patterns and information it has learned from a vast corpus of text data. This technology has brought about a revolution in the way we interact with machines and leverage AI capabilities for various applications.

1.2 Pre-training and Fine-tuning
--------------------------------

ChatGPT's proficiency stems from two key phases: pre-training and fine-tuning.

### 1.2.1 Pre-training

During the pre-training phase, ChatGPT is exposed to a colossal amount of text data from the internet. It learns to predict the next word in
